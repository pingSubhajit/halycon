# Key Security Considerations

Halyon is a service that will let me and other users have a private photo vault that would be stored in my S3 or if someone wants to store in their own S3 bucket that will be possible as well. UI functionality wise it would be much like Google photos but would be highly security focused. So much so that it has to be near impossible to unwanted people to get hold of the photos even when they are loaded in the UI. The service will have a companion mobile app and a web app that will let users upload, batch upload, tag, organize, view, delete, download and manage their photos.
